I am building an application that allows artists and creators to post their works in a public media space, as well as connect patrons 
to creators in their local area.
  The app provides patrons with artistic works for purchase or artists performance locations on a local scale
  Using geolocation, get directions to artists and musicians hosting events near you
  Explore creators pages and view their individual galleries
