I am building an application that allows artists and creators to post their works in a public media space, as well as connect patrons 
to creators in their local area for either business or notoriety purpases.
  - The app provides patrons with artistic works for purchase or artists performance locations on a local scale
    - The closer a Creator is based to your current location, the higher chance you have of seeing their work
  - Using geolocation, get directions to artists and musicians hosting events near you
  - Explore creators pages and view their individual galleries
  
How it works:  
* Creators can upload photos or images advertising their work on a public repository on their home page that will be linked to their account  
* All Creators work are viewable from an explore page  
  * This Explore Page organizes how creators galleries are displayed based off of how close the current user is to the address that the creator is based from  
* Creators are also allowed to host public events by making a post providing a location they intend on being present and when  
  * Any events the creator hosts will be viewable by pin on the Activity Map page  
  * Clicking on these pins on the Activity Map navigates you to that Creators home page where you can see all of their work
