* Application has been tested on only emulator and Onn tablet device
* Application doesn't allow post update or deletion at the moment
* Uploads may take longer than expected and lack progress indicator of upload, meaning if you upload images or videos, you can't do  
  anything for a moment in order for the upload to complete
* Currently can't edit avatar section with image 
* user navigation not implemented with posts on Explore page like they are on the Activity Map
* Project still in need of proper Unit Testing
* Project could use more testing in areas with different wifi network to analyze how well the geolocation works, sometimes this hangs, still need a timeout for this
