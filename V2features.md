* Follow System
  * Allow users to follow each other so that their gallery content shows up in home page
* User to user Messaging
  * Make it easy for users to contact each other for inquiry using Firebase messaging
* Streamlined explore page
  * Instead of showing the whole gallery on the explore page, I'd like to present each users work on a horizontal list on a vertical list for each  
  user instead of just presenting their entire gallery on the explore page. This way you would just see a creators most recent work and can look further  
  if they have something you are interested in with a horizontal swipe
* Optimized user page navigation
  * Allow navigation to users home page by clicking on their username on their posts, currently this only works for caption posts and requires more testing
* Patron/Fan/Enthusiast account creation
  * Add Patron account creation for more casual users of the app who aren't advertising their work but still want to see works for purchase and hosted events in  
  their area
* Audio uploads
* Fullscreen capability for videos
* Post commenting, Linking
* Improved address suggestions
* More detailed posts for hosting events and timers if possible
